This can be particularly useful within shared hosting environments since true-case-path relies on the ability to list a directory's contents in order to check the case and attempting to list the contents of `/` or `/home` will generally result in a permissions error.\n\n```typescript\nconst { trueCasePath } = require('true-case-path')\n\ntrueCasePath('code/my-app/sOmE-FiLe', '/home/casey')\n```\n\n> **NOTE**: When specifying a basePath, the first argument is expected to be the file path _relative to that basePath_. If the first argument is absolute, every path segment will be checked. basePath defaults to `process.cwd()` if not specified and the first argument is relative.\n\n## Platforms\n\nWindows, OSX, and Linux\n\n## Examples\n\n```typescript\nconst { trueCasePathSync } = require('true-case-path')\n\ntrueCasePathSync('/users/guest') // OSX: -> '/Users/Guest'\n\ntrueCasePathSync('c:\\\\users\\\\all users') // Windows: -> 'c:\\Users\\All Users'\n```\n\n[travis-ci]: https://travis-ci.org/Profiscience/true-case-path\n[travis-ci-shield]:
